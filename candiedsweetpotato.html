      <h3>Potatoes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2-3 Korean sweet potatoes </li>
        <li>4 cups vegetable oil</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Sauce</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>&frac13; cup sugar</li>
        <li>&frac13; water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon malt syrup (substitute honey)</li>
        <li>&frac14; teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon black sesame seeds</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
      <p>Peel and wash 2-3 sweet potatoes depending. Cut them into bite-sized pieces, about &frac34; inch to 1 inch squares.</p>
      <p>Soak the cut sweet potatoes in water for 5 minutes. Dry them well with a paper towel. Moisture on the sweet potatoes can cause the hot oil to splash all over you when frying.</p>
      <p>Pour 4 cups of vegetable oil into a pot. Preheat oil to 350 degrees F. Deep-fry the sweet potatoes in preheated oil until they turn golden brown (or until a fork or a chopstick is easily poked into the sweet potatoes).</p>
      <p>Take them out of the oil with a mesh and place them in a strainer or on paper towel to remove some oil.</p>
      <p>In a heated pan, put &frac13; cup of water and &frac13; cup of sugar. Cook it on medium heat without stirring for about 4-5 min or until the sugar is completely melted and the sauce is reduced a bit. Add 1 tablespoon of mulyeot, 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil, &frac14; teaspoon of soy sauce and cook for another 3-5 min.</p>
      <p>Reduce heat to low. Add the deep-fried sweet potatoes and mix them quickly. Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of black sesame seeds.</p>
      <p>Place the candied sweet potatoes on a plate. To prevent the sweet potatoes from sticking to the plate, coat the serving plate with vegetable oil.</p>
